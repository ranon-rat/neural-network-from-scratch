# simple neural network with python

its a really simple neural network that i made for testing and learn ,
i make it based on the videos of:
- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
- [the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/)

its really simple and maybe isnt the most efficient but Im happy with the results
